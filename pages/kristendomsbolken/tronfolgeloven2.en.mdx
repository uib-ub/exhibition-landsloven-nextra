# The right to succession through the female line

    The radical aspect of the rules of succession to the throne in the Laws of the Land is that men received succession rights through the female line. 
    This had been a topic of conflict in the 12th century. 
    Magnus Erlingsson was thus made king because his mother, Kristin, was the daughter of King Sigurd the Crusader. 
    Sverre Sigurdsson, the rival king against Magnus Erlingsson, did not recognize this. 
    Neither did the later kings from Sverre’s clan—until Sverre’s own great-grandchild confirmed this right to succession through his laws. 
    In 1302, the right to succession was extended to the king’s daughter if he had no sons. 
    Theoretically, then, Norway could have had a queen regnant as early as the 14th century. 
    Female succession was later abolished and was not reinstated until 1990. 
    This means that Princess Ingrid Alexandra may one day become Norway’s queen regnant.
