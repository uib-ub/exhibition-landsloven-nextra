    ## Welcome!

The Laws of the Land are divided into sections that contain various major themes. In the medieval manuscripts, the sections are preceded by large, illuminated initials. The older provincial laws had a comparable division, but the order and length of sections, the number of paragraphs, and the content were different. This reflects the long lawmaking process that took place until the Laws of the Land was introduced in 1274.

The Laws of the Land consist of eleven parts, nine of which are called sections:

- Section about Going to Assemblies: the legal system

- Christianity section: on royal and episcopal power

- Land Defence section: protection of life and property

- Human Inviolability: protection of life and property

- List of Inheritance: marriage and inheritance

- Land Redemption: allodial land

- Land Tenancy section: land ownership and lease

- Trade section: trade relations, mortgages, and debts

- Thieves’ section: theft

Moreover, the Laws of the Land contain a Prologue and a concluding part that includes an Epilogue and Law Amendments, which are short texts containing amendments or additions to the applicable law. While the Prologue and Epilogue were not considered a direct part of the laws, the Law Amendments were meant to be used in conjunction with parts of the nine sections. The layout of this exhibition follows the structure of the Laws of the Land.
