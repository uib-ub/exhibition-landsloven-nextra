### LAND REDEMPTION SECTION

Women also had allodial rights. In this charter from Strandebarm, dated February 25th 1457, Ragna Sigurdsdatter confirms that her relative Torgils will inherit her share in the farm Øvre Berven in Ullesvang “with all the things and properties, area, and allodial rights that belong to their land or belonged to it earlier, as well as in the future, both infields and outfield.”
ubb-diplom-0138, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

Sometimes, a settlement or a decision by the authorities based on legal regulations was needed. One of the earliest preserved charters from Norway, the so-called Bleie charter, dated May 26th 1293, concerns precisely such a settlement. This charter announces a settlement between peasants of Indre and Ytre Bleie in Ullensvang. It also provides a great deal of information about work on a farm and life in a village at the end of the 13th century, including fence maintenance and caring for the poor. The document was cut in half along the wavy line where it says “CIROGRAFA”. The other half was identical and was kept by the other party to the settlement. Together, they were proof of the authenticity of the document and the agreement.
ubb-diplom-0002, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

The Laws of the Land outline several options for sale, redemption, and exchange. This charter from Undredal, dated May 2th 1340, certifies that Eindride Erlendsson sold the farm that he had inherited from his mother to Arne Torgeirsson with the intention of redeeming it for the same sum after 10 years. 
ubb-diplom-0023, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

This charter from Vikøy in Kvam, dated September 29th 1564, offers insights into one of the most important aspects of allodial land management, namely the so-called allodial witnesses. Every man or woman who sought to consolidate or change the status of his or her allodial land needed such witnesses. In this case, Sigrid Siversdatter asked Olaf Pedersson, who had lived on the farm, to act as a witness. However, it is uncertain whether he was a satisfactory witness, as he knew nothing more than what was due to her in annual land debt, i.e. rent for the land. 
ubb-diplom-0261, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

One could pledge and redeem allodial land for the same sum for which it was pledged within 60 years. This charter from 1476 certifies that Torkild gave a landed property as a pledge to his nephew Arnfinn. That amount seems to have been considerably higher than the value of the land, so in this case, Torkild clearly received a good price from his near relative. However, it was probably difficult to redeem land. Torkild declared that if he or his son did not redeem the land, Arnfinn and his heirs should have it. The allodial right was maintained because Arnfinn was close family.

### LAND TENANCY SECTION

Redskapsmonter_Landleie_40x280_lav.pdf
Around old dwellings, in fields and meadows, in outfields and summer pastures, near hunting grounds and fishing places, one can find small legacies of those who were here before us. Items that are thrown away or lost over the centuries. Far from being spectacular finds, these are remains of everyday life in the past – small reminders of the people and animals who once lived here, and traces of the agricultural society described in the Laws of the Land.
Round stone fishing net sinker from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1248-1332. 
BRM 0/3897/1, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Soapstone sinker for fishing line from Bryggen, Bergen. Middle Ages. 
BRM 0/16316/1, University Museum of Bergen UiB

Iron fishing hook from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1198–1248. 
BRM 0/41974/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Iron arrowhead from Botn, Voss. The arrow was probably used for hunting, as indicated by the broad blade. Unclear dating. 
B 9481, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Iron ard share reinforcement from Stryn. An ard is a primitive plough that makes furrows in the soil (it does not have a mouldboard like more developed ploughs). This tool was so important that one could take wood from other people’s forests to make it. Unclear dating. 
B 3461, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Iron reinforcement for a spade from Bergen. Unclear dating. 
B 6821, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

### TRADE SECTION

Pottery sherds from Vindenes, Øygarden, from the archaeological survey of the medieval farmstead Høybøen. No ceramics were produced in Norway in the Middle Ages. The sherds show that imported objects also found their way to small farms outside Bergen. The fisher-peasants here probably got them through trade in town. Høybøen was laid waste after the Black Death in 1349. 
B/12624/15/01-05, B/12624/17, B/12624/19, B/12624/31/1, B/12624/49, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Pear-shaped copper alloy weight. Unknown location, Middle Ages. 
BRM 632/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Square copper alloy weight, stamped with B for Bergen, the number 4 and the royal monogram C5. It is connected to King Christian V’s weight reform from the 1680s. Unknown location. 
BRM 631/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Horse-shaped weight made of copper alloy from Enge, Etne. A crown is stamped on the neck and an o or a circle on the back leg. According to the Trade section, measuring vessels, scales and weights were to be inspected and marked. The stamps may perhaps be linked to this practice. The horse weighs 47g, which roughly corresponds to a quarter of a mark, an old Norwegian weight unit. The Middle Ages. 
BRM 1032/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
Horse-shaped copper alloy weight from Sæbø, Etne. Previously, such ”brass horses” were associated with Håkon V Magnusson, but there is no indication that this is true. Great variation in weight and design speaks against a common origin and dating. There are also weights shaped like other animals. Similar weights are also known from Denmark, Sweden and Greenland, but the vast majority are from Norway. The Middle Ages. 
BRM 1298/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Seals like this showed place of origin and was a guarantee for correct quality and quantity of goods. Most likely it was attached to a roll of imported cloth. Dated 1332-1413. 
BRM 0/27517, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Coins in the exhibition 
Counterfeit coins from Kalfarlien, Bergen. Eight out of around 1,800 specimens that were found. They were minted as pennies by Eirik Magnusson, who was king 1280-1299.

Penny ca. 1280 –1285, MA 348/12 
Halfpenny ca. 1285 –1290, MA 348/23 
Halfpenny 1285 – 1290, BMM 3213 
Halfpenny 1285 – 1290, BMM 3509
Most of the coins in the exhibition were found in the cloister church of Nonneseter, near today’s Nonnesetter light rail stop in Bergen. BMM 3213 and BMM 3509 come from Røldal Church in Ullensvang Municipality. 
Silver and copper alloys, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Bismar balance from Osterøy, made of oak with an iron S-hook in a rope. Unknown age, probably 18th or 19th Century. 
X 13731, University Museum in Bergen, UiB

Wooden measuring stick, possibly a cubit measure for measuring cloth. It is nicely carved with, among other things, fruit vines, the year 1652 and the name ABREAHAM BVCHWTx. Unknown origin. 
X 13536, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Bone dice from Bryggen, Bergen. The Trade section states that if someone threw dice for money, the bet should be confiscated, and the players fined. Dated to 1332–1393 and before 1413 respectively. 
X 13731, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Wooden rune stick from Bryggen, Bergen. The front side tells us ”high stakes in dice games has unpredictable outcomes”. On the back is the name Erlend and the word bjóda, which here presumably means to bid or bet money. We are led to believe that Erlend had a gambling problem. Dated 1332-1413, closer to 1332. 
BRM 0/37844/1, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Glass painting showing a man in Renaissance costume weighing a bundle of stockfish with a bismar scale. The text says the man is Torbein Olsson. It also shows his owners´mark and the year 1607. 
X 13638, University Museum in Bergen, UiB

 
### THIEVES’ SECTION

Whip handle from Valdres made from a twisted ox penis with iron fittings. The whip itself, which was attached to the rings in the top, is missing. The handle also served as a club. Originally whips like this were used to drive horses. We know that in the 16th century, sheriffs carried ox penis whips as insignia of honour but also used them as assault weapons and instruments of punishment. 
X 13565, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Large bronze key to Eidfjord church, Eidfjord. According to the Thieves’ Section, a person who committed theft for the second time and could not pay fines was to be branded with a key. Perhaps the key was meant to symbolize St Peter’s key to the gate of the Kingdom of Heaven – a warning that thieves went to hell. The imprint was also meant to warn people that they should take care of their belongings because there was a thief nearby. 
MA 254, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Iron keys from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1476 and 1332–1413 respectively. 
BRM 0/47891 og BRM 0/50321, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
