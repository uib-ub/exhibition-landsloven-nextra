This manuscript fragment from the 14th century is from a codex that contained the Corpus Juris Civilis. This is a collection of civil laws which was originally compiled between 529 and 534, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I the Great. The Corpus Juris Civilis was highly influential in the development of European legislation in the Middle Ages. The fragment is from the second part of the corpus—the Digest, an excerpt from Roman legal writings. The Codex (the first part) contained the laws of earlier emperors, while the Institutions (the third part) was essentially a textbook. Later, the Novels, i.e. the edicts that Justinian himself issued, were added. The Corpus Juris Civilis laid the foundation for legal education at the famous University of Bologna. The codex to which these fragments belonged seems to have been written there. Perhaps it was brought by a Norwegian legal expert who received his education at the famous university. We know that several Norwegians travelled there to study law based on the old Roman and Byzantine traditions during the reigns of Magnus the Lawmender and his father, Håkon Håkonsson.

### LAND DEFENSE SECTION
- In freestanding showcase: 
Reproduction of warrior equipment

The weapons are typical of the armament of a wealthy farmer from the 13th-14th Century. In addition to the “folk weapons” shield, spear and axe or sword, which everyone was obliged to own, here is also chainmail armor and a helmet. This equipment corresponds well to the depictions of levy warriors in Codex Reenhielmianus and Codex Hardenbergianus. Here is also a bow with 24 arrows, of which there should be one set for every other man in a levy warship. These weapon replicas are high quality craftsmanship close to their historical equivalents. 
Helmet or “kettle hat” based on several Norwegian originals. Helmets like this appear to have been common from the mid-13th to the mid-14th century. Forged by Anders Helseth from Helseth’s Hammer. 
Heavy battle axe based on Norwegian medieval finds. Forged by Anders Helseth from Helseth’s Hammer. The handle is made by Anders Dragesund. 
Spear based on Norwegian specimens. Forged by Anders Helseth from Helseth’s Hammer. Shaft by Anders Dragesund. 
Arming sword typical for the period 1270-1350, produced by Tod Cutler. 
The shield is made after European originals from the 13th Century, and also corresponds with the description given in the Laws of the Land. It is made from planks covered with half-tanned leather. 
Chainmail made by AllbestStuff. The shirt has integrated mittens, while the hood is separate. The rings are partly solid, partly closed with a small rivet. A full suit of chainmail usually weighed around 20 kg. Chainmail was so expensive that only a few could afford it. 
The bow is a “two-wood bow” laminated from birch and reaction wood from pine. Reaction wood occurs when a tree has straightened up after almost falling over or has grown in very steep terrain. The birch copes well with tension, and the reaction wood with pressure. Such bows were superior to solid wooden bows. It is assumed that the two-wood bows have Sami origins. The bow is based on a find from Bryggen in Bergen, and is made by bowyer Ivar Malde from Kviljo Buemakeri. 
The arrows are made after finds of shafts and arrowheads from Bryggen in Bergen and other Norwegian medieval finds. Bjørnar Hasle and Dag Sunde have made a dozen (12) each.


Double-edged sword from Hildenes, Nordfjordeid, Stad. There are two grooves along the center of the upper part of the blade. The point is broken off. Dated to 1100–1300. 
B 11213, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Sword cross-guard from Brekke, Stryn. Dated to 1300-1500. 
B 6537, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
 
Arrowheads from Bryggen, Bergen. They are narrow and pointed, suggesting that they were made for warfare. Dated to 1170–1198 and 1413–1476 respectively. 
BRM 0/65010/1, BRM 0/23612/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Battle axe from Valåker, Stryn. This type of axe was used throughout the Middle Ages and is difficult to date more precisely. 
B 11314, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Socket axe from Grov, Gloppen. Axes like this were used for carpentry, for example ship and house building. The shape is typical of the Middle Ages. 
B 11302b, University Museum of Bergen, UiB


Rune stick from Bryggen, Bergen. A war fleet is incised on one side, and a ship and the inscription Here travels the brave at sea on the other. Dated to 1248-1332, most probably early in the time span. Possibly the ships represent King Håkon Håkonsson’s powerful levy fleet. In 1263, he assembled the largest levy fleet in Norwegian history - as many as 120 ships - to defend the Suder Isles, today’s Hebrides, against Scotland. The medieval war ships were a further development of the longships from the Viking Age, perfected through centuries of construction and use. They were fast and seaworthy, both for sail and oars. The sources tell that they usually had 20 or 25 seats, i.e. 20 or 25 pairs of oars, with one man on each oar. The ships were clinker-built, that is, with overlapping planks held together by iron rivets. The same technique is still used in traditional Nordic wooden boat building. 
0/12274/1, Universitetsmuseum of Bergen, UiB 

In peacetime, the levy duty was converted to an annual tax. This charter from Bergen, dated March 6th 1329, confirms that Alfinn in Gjerde and Ogmund Ivarsson had deliverd their levy tax from Voss to the royal estate, including live and slaughtered animals, skins, butter, malt, and grain. 
ubb-diplom-0010, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections, UiB 

Bidding stick made of ash wood and iron. It has remnants of dark green paint and is branded with the initials CJ with a crown above, the monogram of King Carl Johan of Sweden and Norway. It can be dated to his reign, 1818-1844. 
Bd 3896, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Bow fragment from Bryggen, Bergen. The bow was laminated from to types of wood, like the reconstruction in the showcase with the recreated warrior equipment. Dated 1198-1248. 
BRM 0/20302/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Iron candlestick shaped like a longship, from Dale church, Luster. At the top of both stem and stern is a red-painted vane with a crescent moon. The hull has three spikes for candles, and the ship stands on four legs. The ship could be a symbol of both the Church and salvation, and at the same time serve as a reminder of the obligation to defend the land. In Urnes stave church there is a very similar candlestick, but with nine candle spikes. Probably from the 13th century. 
MA 58/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

 
HUMAN INVIOLABILITY SECTION

This charter, dated August 7th 1348, concerns a killing that took place in Bergen in the spring of that year. Governor Ivar Andresson informs King Magnus VII Eriksson that Arne Alfinsson killed Einar Auga and provides a detailed description of the event. These details were meant to clarify, among other things, whether Arne had killed Einar with or without premeditation, whether he had acknowledged his guilt, what had been agreed with the family of the deceased, and what kind of fine had been paid. 
ubb-diplom-0034, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections, UiB

It was not easy to prove one’s innocence in a dispute that ended in the death of one of those involved. The authorities demanded detailed investigations into such incidents and as many witnesses as possible. Usually, six or twelve men decided the question of guilt. This charter from Lista, Agder dated November 26th 1465 concerns the examination of some witnesses about a dispute between Torgeir Aresson and Jon Torkelsson, who had drowned. Torgeir was eventually declared not guilty, but in order to satisfy Jon’s family, he had to pay considerable compensation to Jon’s children. 
ubb-diplom-0150, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections, UiB

The Human Inviolability section did not concern only incidents that involved physical attacks and caused bodily harm or death. It also concerned insults, i.e. verbal assaults that harmed a person’s honour. In most cases, the assaulter had to pay a fine, but sometimes, a retraction of what had been said and an apology for the behaviour sufficed. This is what happened when Sæmund Olavsson apologized for insulting Sigurd Torleifsson, as stated in this charter from Borgund in Sunnmøre dated April 8th 1453. Although the charter does not tell what words had been uttered, it is noted that Sæmund was drunk when he insulted Sigurd.
ubb-diplom-0130, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections, UiB

To the left: Replicas of utility knives and daggers from the Middle Ages.


Bollock dagger with wooden handle from Bryggen, Bergen. The shape of the handle explains the name. Middle Ages. 
BRM 76/11238, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
Bollock dagger with bone handle. Bollock daggers were most often single-edged, unlike most other daggers, which were double-edged. Dated to 1425-1450. 
BRM 346/3362, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Quillon dagger – meaning dagger with cross-guard – from Trå, Voss. Such daggers were often for military use. Dated to 1350–1480. 
B 7150, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Rondel dagger with handle of copper alloy, bone and wood, from Eikenes, Stryn. The term comes from the round grip. Such daggers have long, thin and pointed, yet strong blades, made for stabbing. They were originally weapons of war. Dated to 1425–1525. 
B 6916, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Knife with bone handle from Koren Wibergs plass, Bergen. Middle Ages. 
BRM 0/5500, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

 
INHERITANCE LIST

Drinking horn with gilded copper fittings from Sulen, Gulen. It bears the inscription iaspar melchior baltasar (“Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar”, the names of the three Magi), and the fittings are decorated with a zigzag pattern and an acorn. Drinking horns like this were wide-spread in medieval Norway. They were status symbols used for ritual drinking on solemn occasions. 15th or 16th century. 
MA 108 Universitetsmuseet i Bergen, UiB
Bridal crown made of gilded silver from Møkster, Austevoll. The crown, which is in Renaissance style, was made in Bergen, probably around 1600. It is a silversmith’s work of high craftmanship. The custom of the bride wearing a crown as a symbol of virginity dates back to the Middle Ages. We know from several places in Europe that St. Mary statues in churches could be decorated with metal crowns, which were lent out for wedding ceremonies. In the illumination in the Inheritance list in the Codex Hardenbergianus, the bride is wearing a crown. In Norway, the bridal crown custom survived the Reformation and is still observed. 
HOM 9134a, Hordamuseet, Bymuseet i Bergen 

Silver alloy finger ring from Spurkland, Alver. It is shaped like two hands holding each other and bears rune-like signs on the outside. Rings with handshake motifs are known from large parts of Europe and were presumably used as engagement or wedding rings. The Laws of the Land mention entering into an engagement with a handshake. The first drop cap illumination in the Inheritance list in Codex Hardenbergianus shows a bride and groom giving each other their hands in fidelity. Middle Ages. 
BRM 1074/1 University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Ale bowl made of wood, painted and decorated with a vine motif and script. Long texts on both inside and outside warn against the consequences of uncontrolled drinking. Ale bowls were an important part of the table setting on feasts and holy days. Large bowls like this were often used to fill smaller drinking vessels. The style suggests that this item dates from the transition from the 16th to the 17th century. 
Bd 12879, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

 
LAND REDEMPTION SECTION

Women also had allodial rights. In this charter from Strandebarm, dated February 25th 1457, Ragna Sigurdsdatter confirms that her relative Torgils will inherit her share in the farm Øvre Berven in Ullesvang “with all the things and properties, area, and allodial rights that belong to their land or belonged to it earlier, as well as in the future, both infields and outfield.”
ubb-diplom-0138, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

Sometimes, a settlement or a decision by the authorities based on legal regulations was needed. One of the earliest preserved charters from Norway, the so-called Bleie charter, dated May 26th 1293, concerns precisely such a settlement. This charter announces a settlement between peasants of Indre and Ytre Bleie in Ullensvang. It also provides a great deal of information about work on a farm and life in a village at the end of the 13th century, including fence maintenance and caring for the poor. The document was cut in half along the wavy line where it says “CIROGRAFA”. The other half was identical and was kept by the other party to the settlement. Together, they were proof of the authenticity of the document and the agreement.
ubb-diplom-0002, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

The Laws of the Land outline several options for sale, redemption, and exchange. This charter from Undredal, dated May 2th 1340, certifies that Eindride Erlendsson sold the farm that he had inherited from his mother to Arne Torgeirsson with the intention of redeeming it for the same sum after 10 years. 
ubb-diplom-0023, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

This charter from Vikøy in Kvam, dated September 29th 1564, offers insights into one of the most important aspects of allodial land management, namely the so-called allodial witnesses. Every man or woman who sought to consolidate or change the status of his or her allodial land needed such witnesses. In this case, Sigrid Siversdatter asked Olaf Pedersson, who had lived on the farm, to act as a witness. However, it is uncertain whether he was a satisfactory witness, as he knew nothing more than what was due to her in annual land debt, i.e. rent for the land. 
ubb-diplom-0261, University of Bergen Library, Special Collections

One could pledge and redeem allodial land for the same sum for which it was pledged within 60 years. This charter from 1476 certifies that Torkild gave a landed property as a pledge to his nephew Arnfinn. That amount seems to have been considerably higher than the value of the land, so in this case, Torkild clearly received a good price from his near relative. However, it was probably difficult to redeem land. Torkild declared that if he or his son did not redeem the land, Arnfinn and his heirs should have it. The allodial right was maintained because Arnfinn was close family.

LAND TENANCY SECTION

Redskapsmonter_Landleie_40x280_lav.pdf
Around old dwellings, in fields and meadows, in outfields and summer pastures, near hunting grounds and fishing places, one can find small legacies of those who were here before us. Items that are thrown away or lost over the centuries. Far from being spectacular finds, these are remains of everyday life in the past – small reminders of the people and animals who once lived here, and traces of the agricultural society described in the Laws of the Land.
Round stone fishing net sinker from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1248-1332. 
BRM 0/3897/1, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Soapstone sinker for fishing line from Bryggen, Bergen. Middle Ages. 
BRM 0/16316/1, University Museum of Bergen UiB

Iron fishing hook from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1198–1248. 
BRM 0/41974/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Iron arrowhead from Botn, Voss. The arrow was probably used for hunting, as indicated by the broad blade. Unclear dating. 
B 9481, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Iron ard share reinforcement from Stryn. An ard is a primitive plough that makes furrows in the soil (it does not have a mouldboard like more developed ploughs). This tool was so important that one could take wood from other people’s forests to make it. Unclear dating. 
B 3461, University Museum of Bergen UiB 
Iron reinforcement for a spade from Bergen. Unclear dating. 
B 6821, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

TRADE SECTION

Pottery sherds from Vindenes, Øygarden, from the archaeological survey of the medieval farmstead Høybøen. No ceramics were produced in Norway in the Middle Ages. The sherds show that imported objects also found their way to small farms outside Bergen. The fisher-peasants here probably got them through trade in town. Høybøen was laid waste after the Black Death in 1349. 
B/12624/15/01-05, B/12624/17, B/12624/19, B/12624/31/1, B/12624/49, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Pear-shaped copper alloy weight. Unknown location, Middle Ages. 
BRM 632/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Square copper alloy weight, stamped with B for Bergen, the number 4 and the royal monogram C5. It is connected to King Christian V’s weight reform from the 1680s. Unknown location. 
BRM 631/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Horse-shaped weight made of copper alloy from Enge, Etne. A crown is stamped on the neck and an o or a circle on the back leg. According to the Trade section, measuring vessels, scales and weights were to be inspected and marked. The stamps may perhaps be linked to this practice. The horse weighs 47g, which roughly corresponds to a quarter of a mark, an old Norwegian weight unit. The Middle Ages. 
BRM 1032/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
Horse-shaped copper alloy weight from Sæbø, Etne. Previously, such ”brass horses” were associated with Håkon V Magnusson, but there is no indication that this is true. Great variation in weight and design speaks against a common origin and dating. There are also weights shaped like other animals. Similar weights are also known from Denmark, Sweden and Greenland, but the vast majority are from Norway. The Middle Ages. 
BRM 1298/1, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 
Seals like this showed place of origin and was a guarantee for correct quality and quantity of goods. Most likely it was attached to a roll of imported cloth. Dated 1332-1413. 
BRM 0/27517, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Coins in the exhibition 
Counterfeit coins from Kalfarlien, Bergen. Eight out of around 1,800 specimens that were found. They were minted as pennies by Eirik Magnusson, who was king 1280-1299.

Most of the coins in the exhibition were found in the cloister church of Nonneseter, near today’s Nonnesetter light rail stop in Bergen. BMM 3213 and BMM 3509 come from Røldal Church in Ullensvang Municipality. 
Silver and copper alloys, University Museum of Bergen, UiB

Bismar balance from Osterøy, made of oak with an iron S-hook in a rope. Unknown age, probably 18th or 19th Century. 
X 13731, University Museum in Bergen, UiB

Wooden measuring stick, possibly a cubit measure for measuring cloth. It is nicely carved with, among other things, fruit vines, the year 1652 and the name ABREAHAM BVCHWTx. Unknown origin. 
X 13536, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Bone dice from Bryggen, Bergen. The Trade section states that if someone threw dice for money, the bet should be confiscated, and the players fined. Dated to 1332–1393 and before 1413 respectively. 
X 13731, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Wooden rune stick from Bryggen, Bergen. The front side tells us ”high stakes in dice games has unpredictable outcomes”. On the back is the name Erlend and the word bjóda, which here presumably means to bid or bet money. We are led to believe that Erlend had a gambling problem. Dated 1332-1413, closer to 1332. 
BRM 0/37844/1, University Museum in Bergen, UiB 

Glass painting showing a man in Renaissance costume weighing a bundle of stockfish with a bismar scale. The text says the man is Torbein Olsson. It also shows his owners´mark and the year 1607. 
X 13638, University Museum in Bergen, UiB

 
THIEVES’ SECTION

Whip handle from Valdres made from a twisted ox penis with iron fittings. The whip itself, which was attached to the rings in the top, is missing. The handle also served as a club. Originally whips like this were used to drive horses. We know that in the 16th century, sheriffs carried ox penis whips as insignia of honour but also used them as assault weapons and instruments of punishment. 
X 13565, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Large bronze key to Eidfjord church, Eidfjord. According to the Thieves’ Section, a person who committed theft for the second time and could not pay fines was to be branded with a key. Perhaps the key was meant to symbolize St Peter’s key to the gate of the Kingdom of Heaven – a warning that thieves went to hell. The imprint was also meant to warn people that they should take care of their belongings because there was a thief nearby. 
MA 254, University Museum of Bergen, UiB 

Iron keys from Bryggen, Bergen. Dated to 1476 and 1332–1413 respectively. 
BRM 0/47891 og BRM 0/50321, University Museum of Bergen, UiB
