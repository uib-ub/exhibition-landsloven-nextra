In the Laws of the Land, the epilogue follows the two law amendments of King Håkon Håkonsson and his son, King Magnus the Lawmender, the initiator of the law code. Although the epilogue is very short, it provides important information for the history of the Laws of the Land. In the text, we are told that King Magnus went himself to the assembly, had the book read aloud there and therewith introduced the law to the whole of Norway. Furthermore, the epilogue tells us the year and date of the introduction of the law code, which in most manuscripts is set to St. John's Day (24.6.1274) for all four law assemblies in Norway. The epilogue ends, like the prologue, with an invocation to Christ, as well as Mary, St. Johannes and St. Olav Haraldsson.
