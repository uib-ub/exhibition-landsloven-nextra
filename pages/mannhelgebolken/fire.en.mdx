# “God’s four daughters”

The earlier provincial laws were often the result of older jurisprudence.
The Law of the Land, on the other hand, was primarily based on what can be called normative legislation and specified how things shall or should be.
“Normal” behaviour was good and desirable, while the opposite was bad and impermissible.
Thus, the Law of the Land was, in a sense, the first step towards modern legislation.
Many of the normative parts of the Law of the Land are linked to Christian ethics.
In the 13th century, this was the result of influences from the Dominican and Franciscan orders, the “new” monastic orders that characterized Norwegian towns.
In particular, the law referred to the (almost unknown until that time) story of God’s four daughters—truth, freedom, mercy, and justice—with regard to how a judge should proceed:

“And the four sisters are Mercy and Verity, Justice and Peace. 
Mercy is to prevent cruelty or hatred from entering judgements. 
Verity is to ensure that lies will not be told. 
Justice is to prevent unrighteousness from skewing just judgements. 
Peace is to guard against a vehement judgement of condemnation being passed in anger until a just judgement is made.”
