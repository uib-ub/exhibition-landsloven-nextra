# Knives for utility and trouble

“If the person who was stabbed innocent dies, then the one who stabbed can be killed with impunity.”

Human Inviolability section, chapter 15

<Work id="ubb-diplom-0034" />

In the Middle Ages, a knife was an important part of personal equipment, both as a multipurpose tool and as an eating utensil, and was usually carried in the belt. With knives readily available, there was a chance that they would be used for violence or intimidation. Because the Human Inviolability section threatens harsh punishments for crimes involving knives, there is good reason to suspect that this was a common problem. Merely drawing a knife against someone was to be punished with a full “man’s fine.” If someone stabbed someone else with a knife, the king’s representative was to “take the knife with which they stabbed, and thrust it through their hand there at the assembly.” In addition, the offender had to pay fines to both the victim and the king. Killing an innocent person with a knife incurred the death penalty or outlawry and exile if the murderer escaped.
