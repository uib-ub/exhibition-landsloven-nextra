# The archbishop’s coins

From 1228 until 1281, the archbishop of Nidaros also had the right to mint coins. This privilege was confirmed by Magnus the Lawmender in his reconciliation with Archbishop Jon Raude in 1277. Initially, it was probably primarily the revenue from coin production that was important to the archbishops. The king was to decide the stamps on the coins, which were confusingly similar to his own. However, the cunning Jon Raude minted a bracteate with a bishop’s head wearing a mitre (a bishop’s headdress). Eirik Magnusson’s guardian council, which wished to limit the power of the Church, abolished the archbishop’s right to mint coins in 1281. From 1458 to 1537, the archbishop was again allowed to mint coins. During the excavations at the archbishop’s estate in Trondheim in the 1990s, a medieval mint workshop was discovered, and one of the phases of its use is preserved as it was found.
