# King Håkons’s Hall and the legislative work

We must assume that most of the law revision work under King Magnus took place at the royal estate on Holmen, i.e. today’s Bergenhus Fortress. King Håkon’s Hall stands out as the building most central to the work on the Laws of the Land. This work likely took place in the vaulted rooms on the middle floor of the building. Although the Laws of the Land were passed at the various regional thing assemblies, we must assume that it was also presented in the great hall, which was the worthiest setting for royal celebrations. The drop cap illumination of the Prologue in Codex Hardenbergianus shows King Magnus handing over the Laws of the Land. We can imagine this scene taking place in Håkon’s Hall, with the king sitting on the hall’s highest throne. Today’s design of the wall section behind the thrones dates from the restoration in 1880–1895 and 1944-1960, but is based on original remains. It is believed to give a fairly correct overall impression of King Magnus’s throne. On the right, you can see one of the original stones from the wall behind the throne, which was removed during the first restoration. This stone has been close to both King Magnus and the events in the hall related to the Laws of the Land.
