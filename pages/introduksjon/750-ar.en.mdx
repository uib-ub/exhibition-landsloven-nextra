# Magnus the Lawmender’s Laws of the Land: 750 years

In 1274, King Magnus VI Håkonsson presented his Laws of the Land. Between 1274 and 1276, they were approved by all four regional assemblies as a replacement for the old provincial laws. The Laws of the Land remained in effect for over 400 years.

Although we know little about King Magnus as a person, both his legislative work and other sources suggest that he was a wise king with a strong sense of justice. He took over legislative authority from the regional assemblies and created a more consistent legal system. The Laws for the Land was a milestone on the path towards centralized state power. Because of his efforts to reform the laws, King Magnus became known as the Lawmender.

The 750th anniversary of Magnus the Lawmender’s Laws of the Land is being celebrated all over Norway. This exhibition is the main event in the celebration of the Laws of the Land jubilee in Vestland County. It is the result of a close collaboration between Bymuseet i Bergen, the University of Bergen by the University of Bergen Library and the University Museum of Bergen, and Vestland County. The exhibition has a Bergen and Vestland perspective.

The exhibition adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the Laws of the Land and the society for which they were created. Like the provisions of the Laws of the Land, the content of the exhibition ranges from the grand and dramatic to the simple and ordinary. Emphasis has also been placed on creating a solemn and evocative setting for King Magnus’s life work.
