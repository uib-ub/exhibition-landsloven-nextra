# Bergen and the town legislator Magnus

In the 13th century, Bergen was the most important trading and residential town in Norway. It was most likely also here that most of the legislative work under King Magnus the Lawmender took place. Besides the remaining medieval buildings in today’s Bergenhus fortress, traces related to the legislator king Magnus can also be found in the medieval town centre, which corresponded to today’s Bryggen and Vågsbunnen. In 1276, two years after the Laws of the Land was adopted, King Magnus had a separate town law passed for Bergen, which would soon be adapted to other Norwegian cities. Thus, King Magnus was actively involved in organizing and regulating the city’s life and economic activities. Magnus the Lawmender is perhaps the king who most clearly contributed to shaping the centre of Bergen such as we have inherited it.
