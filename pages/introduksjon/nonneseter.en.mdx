# Nonneseter and the king’s son Olav

<Container stil="initial side">
    Nonneseter is best known today as a light rail stop, but still includes a medieval building that can be linked to King Magnus: the current Chapel of Nonneseter, a preserved part of the church in the nunnery of the Benedictine nuns. In 1262, King Magnus and Queen Ingebord left their newborn and perhaps disabled son Olav with the nuns when they left Bergen for the winter. The king’s son died a few years later. This is probably why Magnus gave a large amount of money to Nonneseter in 1277. This enabled the nuns to expand the convent and build the chapel that stands to this day.
