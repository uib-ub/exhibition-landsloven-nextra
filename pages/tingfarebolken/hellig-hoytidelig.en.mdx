# Holy and solemn

“And the royal magistrate is to have a great bell rung when he wishes to go to the assembly with a law book .”

Section about Going to Assemblies, chapter 3

The regional assemblies go back to pre-Christian times, but the role of the old cults at the assemblies is unknown. A remnant was a hazel fence called véband a in Old Norse that separated the court – those who judged – from the rest of the assembly. Vé was the term for a place that was holy and inviolable. No one other than the members of the court had the right to cross this holy band, and the members of the court were not allowed to step outside for the duration of the legal proceedings. With the introduction of Christianity, Christian rituals were incorporated into the thing assemblies. In the Section about Going to Assemblies, it is stated that the church bell should be rung when the royal magistrate went to the thing assembly with the law book, which is reminiscent of a religious procession. One had to swear on a holy book, with God as a witness. One should fast before going to the thing assembly and should not allow oneself to be distracted by food and drink while the meeting was in progress. Those who disturbed the members of the court or the litigants were fined. The thing assembly’s peace was to be kept not only during the proceedings but from the moment one left home until one returned. Everyone was to have grid, meaning free passage to and from the thing assembly. Whoever killed or maimed someone at the thing assembly was declared an outlaw, and other acts of violence carried double fines. Weapons were confiscated, and their carriers were also fined.
