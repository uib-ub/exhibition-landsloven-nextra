    The Gulathing assembly was one of the four Norwegian regional assemblies, and, according to Snorri Sturluson’s Heimskringla, it was created by Håkon (the Good) Adalsteinsfostre, who reigned between ca 933 and 961. 
    However, the Gulathing assembly had most likely been established before Håkon became king, and probably without royal initiative. 
    In the 12th century, the Icelandic historian Are Frode claimed that the Gulathing assembly was the model for the Althing assembly in Iceland, established in 930. 
    This suggest that the Gulathing assembly originally was also an assembly for all free men. 
    The oldest Gulathing assembly was probably located near the church in Eivindvik in Gulen municipality. 
    Today, two stone crosses survive there, which can probably be linked to the site of the assembly. 
    The Gulathing assembly was moved to Guløy in the first half of the 13th century, and shortly after 1300 it was moved to Bergen. 
    According to Egil’s saga, in the early 10th century, the Gulathing assembly included only Sogn, Fjordane, and Hordaland. 
    Soon after it also came to include Agder, Rogaland, and Sunnmøre. 
    Like the other three judicial provinces in Norway, the Gulathing was a representative regional assembly, with several subordinate local assemblies. 
    Only legal conflicts that could not be resolved at the lower levels were brought to the Gulathing assembly. 
    Although the assembly’s jurisdiction was expanded, the number of representatives was reduced on several occasions. 
    Originally, there were 375 representatives, who were reduced to 246 in the 1170s and then to 148 after the adoption of the Laws of the Land in 1274. 
    At the centre of the regional assembly sat the law council, which, according to the Laws of the Land, was to consist of 36 sworn men appointed to judge, led by the royal magistrate.
