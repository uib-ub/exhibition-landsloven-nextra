    Norway is an elongated and diverse country, with great differences in landscape types, soil, and climate. 
    Overall, people adapted to local conditions and resources. 
    In some places, it was possible to rely entirely on agriculture, whereas in other places, it was necessary to have more varied resources for sustenance. 
    Therefore, the Land Tenancy section also mentions forestry, fishing and hunting. 
    The Land Tenancy section is an important source concerning agriculture in the Middle Ages. 
    It provides information about fertilization and periodic land fallowing, building and maintaining fences, herding animals, summer pastures, and much more. 
    It also provides descriptions of details of farmyards and buildings. 

    Grain was the most important agricultural product and the main ingredient in commoners’ diet, in the form of porridge, bread, and beer. 
    Some districts produced a surplus of grain, whereas others produced so little that they had to buy it, at least during years of hardship. 
    The Laws of the Land prohibited anyone from enriching themselves by overpricing during years of scarcity. 
    In the Land Tenancy section, various herbal and kitchen beds and gardens, orchards, and the cultivation of onions, cabbages, angelica, turnips, peas, and beans (horse beans) are also mentioned. 

    Regarding farm animals, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs are mentioned. 
    Particular mention is made of horses and cattle, the most important and valuable animals on farms. 
    Dogs are also mentioned in many instances. 
    Agriculture was difficult and labour intensive. 
    Most tasks were performed by hand, although some had horses and oxen for assistance. 
    Peasants used simple, home-made tools, quite similar to those used until the mid-19th century. 
    They were mainly made of wood, with blades, points and fittings of precious iron. 
    Wood for tools was carefully selected. 
    This particularly applied to ard and plough. 
    They were so important that one could cut wood for them in someone else’s forest.
