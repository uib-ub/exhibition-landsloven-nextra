# The best men

In the Prologue to the Laws of the Land, it is stated that the members of the different regional assemblies asked King Magnus Håkonsson about “improving most of the law books in the land, with the advice of the most excellent people”. It is not known who these men were, but the text probably refers to the group of learned and trusted men who were responsible for compiling and revising the content of the Laws of the Land. We know of at least three such key persons who acted as advisers to the king at the time when the Laws of the Land were created:

Audun Hugleiksson was one of the highest-ranking officials at King Magnus’ court. According to the saga of Bishop Arne, Audun was the most knowledgeable about the Norwegian provincial laws in the 1270s. He probably studied law in Bologna and was one of the most active envoys abroad under both King Magnus and his father Håkon Håkonsson.

Bailiff and chancellor Tore Håkonsson, who had studied canon law abroad, was an equally active envoy. He also acted, along with Audun, as an observer of church affairs for the king both in Norway and abroad in the second half of the 13th century.

British-born Askatin served as a chancellor for both King Håkon and King Magnus, and he was a bishop in Bjørgvin (Bergen) when the Laws of the Land were written. He acted as an envoy to the Holy Roman Empire, Denmark and England.
