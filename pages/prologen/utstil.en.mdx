# The Laws of the Land in the exhibition

<Container stil="initial side">
    None of the original copies of the Laws of the Land presented to the Ting councils in the mid-1270s have been preserved, but 43 Law of the Land manuscripts in Old Norse survive.

    Thirty-nine of them date from the Middle Agesâ€”most from the first half of the 14th century and the most recent from the 16th century.
