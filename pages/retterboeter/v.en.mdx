# Christian V’s Norwegian Code

After being in force for more than 400 years, the Laws of the Land were replaced with Christian V’s Norwegian Code in 1687. The introduction of the Danish–Norwegian absolute monarchy in the 17th century paved the way for the revision of the medieval laws, first in Denmark and then in Norway. The king needed new legislation that suited the spirit of the times and supported his absolute power. The letter of the law was also to be absolute, with as little room for interpretation as possible. Book printing had become an important factor in modern legislation. Whereas in the past no single copy of laws was identical to another, laws could now be printed in large numbers and in unaltered form. This gave laws increased authority. The Danish Code of 1683 was the first law that applied to the whole of Denmark. It was the starting point for the Norwegian Code, which was issued four years later. Norwegian jurists contributed to the legislative work, which resulted in a certain degree of adaptation to Norwegian interests and customary law. Because the Norwegian Code encompassed all legal areas and the entire population, it represented a more comprehensive legal framework than the Laws of the Land. This was a modern law based on contemporary European jurisprudence. Criminal law became significantly harsher than the Laws of the Land because it emphasized prevention, i.e. deterring people from committing crimes. Absolute monarchy and the Norwegian Code were in force in Norway until the secession from Denmark in 1814. Then, Norway became a constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the head of state is limited by the constitution. The Norwegian Constitution of May 17 1814 divides state power into three central bodies: the parliament, i.e. the legislative and controlling power; the king and the government, i.e. the executive power; and the courts, i.e. the judicial power.
