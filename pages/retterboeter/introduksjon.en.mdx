“We expect that is known to you, as well as to many other people in our kingdom, especially the most prudent, that the law book that the honourable lord King Magnus, our father, produced, in some cases does not seem to provide the clear reasoning that people need, and there are more circumstances in the cases than one can expect such a small book to determine.”

Law amendment by Eirik Magnusson’s guardian council, 2 July 1280
