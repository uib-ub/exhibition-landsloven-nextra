# Norwegian law today

Modern Norwegian legislation is still largely based on written law, with the parliament as the legislative branch of government. The parliament consists of elected representatives from the entire country, giving Norwegian law democratic legitimacy. The Norwegian Constitution occupies a special position as the foundation of the Norwegian state and various forms of exercising authority. All public authorities must comply with the law, which contributes to Norway being regarded as a country governed by the rule of law. International obligations become part of Norwegian law through the parliament’s legislative acts. It follows, for example, from Norway’s Human Rights Act that the human rights, to which the country has committed itself, take precedence over provisions in Norwegian legislation (with the exception of the Constitution) because the legislature itself has given human rights such as position. Norwegian law is the basis for the legal system practised in courts and public administration. Matters regarding the interpretation of the law are discussed and clarified by professional jurists, and legal conflicts are settled in courts or similar conflict resolution bodies.
