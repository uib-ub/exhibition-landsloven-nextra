# On printing and paper

<Container stil="initial side">
    Technological innovations often mark the transition to a new cultural era. In the culture of writing, the invention of the printing press was the most important development before the modern digital era. In the Western world, Johannes Gutenberg is recognized as the first to print books using movable type. The year 1450, when he printed his famous Bible, is considered the start of the history of printed books in the West. However, the Chinese pioneered book printing and movable type centuries before the technology was developed in Europe. The art of printing led to dramatic labour and cost reductions in book production. Mass production contributed to increased literacy rates and access to books. Printing eliminated errors and discrepancies that were common when manuscripts were copied by hand. The standardization of content also helped consolidate the authority of both religious and legal books. Another important technological innovation that gained traction in the Western world in the 15th century was paper production. Again, this was pioneered by the Chinese. The use of paper slowly spread westwards, particularly via the Muslim world, but several centuries passed before paper was valued higher than parchment. Paper pulp was initially made from cloth. Wood pulp paper, which dominates today, is an invention of the 19th century. In Norway, there was no paper production until the 18th century. Today however, Norway is one of the largest producers of paper in the world.

This charter from Vereide, dated May 14th 1542, is one of the oldest known charters written on paper, thus showing an important technological innovation. Since paper is torn more easily and could not bear the weight of seals like parchment could, seals do not hang from such charters. Instead, the seals were printed on the bottom part of the paper
