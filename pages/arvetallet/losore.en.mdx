Movable assets are tradable items that are not tied to real property. It could be money, equipment, and livestock. In the Middle Ages, buildings were also probably considered movable assets. They were mostly built of wood, and they could be dismantled and moved. Among types of assets, allodial land ranked higher than other landed properties, which, in turn, ranked higher than movable properties. In the case of an allodial farm, the law stipulated that the sons should inherit it, while the daughters should inherit other landed properties and movable assets.
