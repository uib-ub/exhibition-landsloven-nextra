# Assets

“If a man purchases a piece of land with his wife’s objects or money   or livestock, and she survives him, she shall only have land from his property equal to what she received as dowry, and any more only if the heir agrees to it.”

List of Inheritance, chapter 4

Movable assets are tradable items that are not tied to real property. It could be money, equipment, and livestock. In the Middle Ages, buildings were also probably considered movable assets. They were mostly built of wood, and they could be dismantled and moved. Among types of assets, allodial land ranked higher than other landed properties, which, in turn, ranked higher than movable properties. In the case of an allodial farm, the law stipulated that the sons should inherit it, while the daughters should inherit other landed properties and movable assets.
