A dowry was something that a woman brought to her marriage from her parents or alternatively from another person in charge of her marriage. It functioned as an advance on inheritance. Before the Laws of the Land were introduced, a dowry would have consisted mostly of movable property. It could be livestock, furniture, money, clothes, etc. After the Laws of the Land introduced the right to inheritance for women, it also became common practice for land to be given as a dowry. The dowry was the woman’s property, and it was not part of the inheritance after the husband if he died. Nor did the man inherit it if his wife died before him. It was to be returned to her family. Repeated infidelity on the woman’s part could lead to her losing the dowry.
