# Dowry

<Blockquote 
    quote='“A woman is not to be given away with textiles forming more than one-third of her dowry. And anything that the person responsible for the woman’s marriage bestows from home is to be in the form of things which will be to the gain and benefit of the groom.”'

    A dowry was something that a woman brought to her marriage from her parents or alternatively from another person in charge of her marriage. It functioned as an advance on inheritance. Before the Laws of the Land were introduced, a dowry would have consisted mostly of movable property. It could be livestock, furniture, money, clothes, etc. After the Laws of the Land introduced the right to inheritance for women, it also became common practice for land to be given as a dowry. The dowry was the woman’s property, and it was not part of the inheritance after the husband if he died. Nor did the man inherit it if his wife died before him. It was to be returned to her family. Repeated infidelity on the woman’s part could lead to her losing the dowry.

This charter witnesses that the property that women brought into the marriage stayed with them until they died or decided to sell.
