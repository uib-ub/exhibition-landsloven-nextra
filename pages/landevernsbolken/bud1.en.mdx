# Sending messages

“The person who is able to represent words or oaths accurately is to carry messages between farms.”

Land Tenancy section, chapter 54

In a large country with scattered settlements, it was essential to have an effective way to convey important messages. The earlier provincial laws inform us that sending bidding sticks was a widespread form of communication as early as the late Viking Era. Bidding sticks announced important events and summoned people to assemblies, council meetings and joint efforts. Bidding sticks were used for military, ecclesiastical, judicial, and civilian purposes, and they are mentioned in the Laws of the Land in many contexts: military mobilization, notification of murder, prosecution of looters, launching and landing of military and civilian ships, road works, etc. The way of sending messages is described in the Land Tenancy section. Bidding sticks followed a fixed route between settlements, and the recipients were obliged to pass them on to the next place along the route. This was basically the responsibility of the husband or the housewife if he was not present, or else the highest in rank among those present at home. If no one of legal age was at home, the bidding stick was placed visibly next to the head seat of the table or above the door. Punishment awaited those who intercepted or ignored a bidding stick, ranging from being fined to being declared an outlaw, depending on how important the message was.
