# Weapons and weapon assembly

    Peasants had to keep their own weapons as part of their levy obligations. 
    Everyone was to have the “peoples’ weapons”: a shield, a spear, and a sword or axe. 
    Besides this, the required armature depended on one’s wealth. 
    Wealthy peasants had to have a shield of high quality, a steel hat (i.e. 
    a simple helmet with a brim), and a quilted arming coat or chainmail armour. 
    In other words, the richest were the best-equipped for battle. 
    Weapons were expensive and often passed down for generations. 
    Apart from personal equipment, levy ship crewmen had to work in pairs to procure a bow and 24 arrows. 
    Every year, sometime between Candlemas (February 2) and the middle of Lent (which changes annually), the peasants of each “warship district” were summoned to a weapon assembly to display their weapons. 
    They paraded in procession, three abreast, before the governor and other royal representatives. 
    One had to pay a fine for each weapon that was missing or did not meet the quality requirements.
