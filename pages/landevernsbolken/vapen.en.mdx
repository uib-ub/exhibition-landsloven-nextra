# Weapons and weapon assembly

“If anyone lacks these weapons, there is a penalty of an ounce of silver to the king”

Land defence section, chapter 11

Peasants had to keep their own weapons as part of their levy obligations. Everyone was to have the “peoples’ weapons”: a shield, a spear, and a sword or axe. Besides this, the required armature depended on one’s wealth. Wealthy peasants had to have a shield of high quality, a steel hat (i.e. a simple helmet with a brim), and a quilted arming coat or chainmail armour. In other words, the richest were the best-equipped for battle. Weapons were expensive and often passed down for generations. Apart from personal equipment, levy ship crewmen had to work in pairs to procure a bow and 24 arrows. Every year, sometime between Candlemas (February 2) and the middle of Lent (which changes annually), the peasants of each “warship district” were summoned to a weapon assembly to display their weapons. They paraded in procession, three abreast, before the governor and other royal representatives. One had to pay a fine for each weapon that was missing or did not meet the quality requirements.
