# Bidding sticks

“And for all men to whose home an arrow arrives, it summons him to ship if he lives on the coast, but the gathering of the army inland.”

Land defence section, chapter 3

A bidding stick was a piece of wood that served as a message. Some of them, called arrows and crosses, probably had a specific shape or were marked in some way but likely they did not bear runes or any other script. The message itself was delivered orally along with the bidding stick. In case of hostilities, so-called war arrows were to be sent out throughout the country, both at sea and along the main roads, and from there to the farmsteads, to mobilize the army. They were to be transported day and night and accompanied by several people. Arrow bidding sticks were also sent out in cases of looting raids, killings, and serious violent incidents. It is reasonable to assume that these bidding sticks indeed looked like arrows. It is unknown whether there was something that distinguished arrow bidding sticks for different purposes. Unfortunately, no bidding sticks dating from the Middle Ages have been identified. The oldest known ones bear the monogram of King Christian V of Denmark–Norway, who reigned from 1670 until 1699. These were cylindrical and hollowed out to hold a written message and had a spike at one end so that they could be attached to a visible place. The bidding stick in this exhibition is of this type and is embossed with the monogram of King Carl Johan of Sweden and Norway, who reigned from 1818 to 1844. Bidding sticks were used in Norway until the beginning of the 20th century. To this day, several newspapers include the word “budstikke” (bidding stick) in their names simply because they spread news.
