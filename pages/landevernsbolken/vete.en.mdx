# Beacons

“Guards are to light the beacon upon seeing three or more warships”

Land defence section, chapter 4

Many Norwegian mountaintops and hills, both along the coast and further inland in the fjords and valleys, bear names derived from beacons or cairns or other names with a similar meaning. A beacon was a signal fire lit to warn of a threat and mobilize defences against the enemy. Beacons were located in places with a good view so that an enemy could be spotted, and they had a line of sight to peaks with other beacons. There, new fires were lit to propagate the warning. Beacons along sea lanes were the most important since danger most often came from there. According to Snorri Sturluson, it was King Håkon the Good who introduced the warning beacon system in the mid-10th century. The use of the beacons is also described in the provincial laws of Gulathing and Frostathing. The system had been tried and tested by the time the Laws of the Land were written, and the beacon network had been greatly expanded since its inception. As in other cases, King Magnus the Lawemender standardized the system for the entire country, whereas several practices had been in place previously. He also introduced guard huts for the crews with doors on four sides to provide a panoramic view. On many mountaintops, ruins of such guard huts survive to this day. The beacons were manned only in times of danger. It was a great responsibility to be a beacon guard. The Laws of the Land stipulated that three adult men with “healthy eyes and ears and feet” were to stand guard. A warning was to be transmitted if three or more warships were seen. Lighting a fire for no reason or failing to warn of a danger was punishable by a fine. Neglecting one’s duty in any other way also carried a fine. Beacons were used in Norway as late as during the Great Northern War (1700–1721) and were refurbished during the Napoleonic Wars (1807–1814). Today, we go hiking on mountaintops where the beacons used to lie and look down at the sea and the maritime traffic without great anxiety. We receive warnings on our mobile phones if something happens.
