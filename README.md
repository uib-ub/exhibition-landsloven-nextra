# Landslovjubileet 2024

This is the repo for the digital exhibition of the 2024 jubilee of _Landsloven_. The site is built with [Nextra](//nextra.site) and is statically generated from markdown files. The code is hosted on github and the site is hosted on Vercel.

Nextra is built with the Next.js framework that allows you to build static sites from markdown files. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) for styling and MDX for rendering React components in markdown files. Many of the works in the exhibition are rendered with the [Clover-IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) viewer.

## Components

The components are written in TypeScript and are located in the `components` folder. The `work.tsx` component is used to render the IIIF Manifest with Clover-IIIF.

All components are imported from `components/???` as a tsconfig path has been set up for easier importing no matter what folder level the page is on.

Component filenames are in cebab-case, and the component name is in PascalCase. E.g. `work.tsx` exports the `Work` component.

### Work

The `Work` component is used to render the IIIF Manifest with Clover-IIIF. It takes an `id` prop that is the IIIF Manifest ID. The component is wrapped in a `Suspense` component to handle the loading state.

```jsx
<Work id="ubb-ms-0558" />
```

It can also take a `url` prop that is the URL to the IIIF Manifest. This is useful when the manifest is not hosted on the same domain as the site.

*NB*! The National Library of Norway's IIIF Manifests are not CORS enabled, so they cannot be used with the `url` prop.

```jsx
<Work url="https://api.nb.no/catalog/v1/iiif/9fc1417235e4f584c7bcc667b9e77ba2/manifest" />
```
